[[first_header]]
# Some top level section header


[[second_header]]
## Some second level section header


[[2D_section]]
## Some invalid link label section header

In this text we refer to section <<first_header>>, where you can read all about section <<second_header, Some second header>>.
Also, there might be a <<third_header, third section>>, that is actually still missing.

Finally, we got a link back to the <<main, main topic>> and a link to <<image_ref, an image>>.
